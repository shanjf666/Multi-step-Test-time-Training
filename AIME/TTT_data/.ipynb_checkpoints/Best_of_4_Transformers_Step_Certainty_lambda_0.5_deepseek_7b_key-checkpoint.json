            "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given logarithmic equations We are given the equations $\\log_xw=24$, $\\log_y w = 40$, and $\\log_{xyz}w=12$. We need to find $\\log_zw$. ## Step 2: Convert the logarithmic equations to exponential form Converting the logarithmic equations to exponential form, we get $w = x^{24}$, $w = y^{40}$, and $w = z^{12}$. ## Step 3: Express $w$ in terms of $x$, $y$, and $z$ From the first equation, we can express $w$ as $w = x^{24}$. From the second equation, we can express $w$ as $w = y^{40}$. From the third equation, we can express $w$ as $w = z^{12}$. ## Step 4: Equate the expressions for $w$ from the first two equations Since $w$ is the same in all three equations, we can equate the expressions for $w$ from the first two equations: $x^{24} = y^{40}$. ## Step 5: Express $y$ in terms of $x$ Taking the 40th root of both sides of the equation $x^{24} = y^{40}$, we get $y = x^{24/40} = x^{3/5}$. ## Step 6: Substitute the expression for $y$ into the equation for $w$ Substituting $y = x^{3/5}$ into the equation $w = y^{40}$, we get $w = (x^{3/5})^{40} = x^{12}$. ## Step 7: Equate the expressions for $w$ from the first and third equations Since $w$ is the same in all three equations, we can equate the expressions for $w$ from the first and third equations: $x^{24} = z^{12}$. ## Step 8: Express $z$ in terms of $x$ Taking the 12th root of both sides of the equation $x^{24} = z^{12}$, we get $z = x^{24/12} = x^{2}$. ## Step 9: Substitute the expression for $z$ into the equation for $w$ Substituting $z = x^{2}$ into the equation $w",
