            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives from her ducks each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs used for muffins} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet has left each day:** \\[ \\text{Eggs left} = \\text{Total eggs received} - \\text{Total eggs used} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine how much Janet sells each fresh duck egg:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. 7. **Calculate the total amount Janet makes each day at the farmers' market:** \\[ \\text{Total amount made} = \\text{Eggs left} \\times \\text{Price per egg} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber needed. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber needed. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, the white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] 3. To find the total number of bolts, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
