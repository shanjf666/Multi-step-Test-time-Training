            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet collects each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes daily (eats for breakfast and uses for baking). 3. Calculate the number of eggs remaining after consumption. 4. Multiply the number of remaining eggs by the price per egg to find out how much she makes each day. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes 4 eggs for her friends every day. So, the total number of eggs she consumes daily is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 3. The number of eggs remaining after consumption is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 4. Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount she makes each day is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] So, the final answer is: \\[ \\boxed{18} \\]",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. According to the problem, the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the amount of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] 3. Calculate the total amount of fiber by adding the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
