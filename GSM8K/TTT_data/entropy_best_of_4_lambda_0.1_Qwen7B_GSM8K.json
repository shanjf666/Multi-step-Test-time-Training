            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how many fresh duck eggs Janet sells each day and how much she makes from them, we can follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs used each day:** Total eggs used each day = eggs eaten + eggs used for muffins \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 5. **Calculate the number of fresh duck eggs left each day:** Fresh duck eggs left each day = total eggs laid - total eggs used \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 6. **Determine how much Janet makes from selling the fresh duck eggs each day:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Total earnings} = \\text{fresh duck eggs left} \\times \\text{price per egg} \\] \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. According to the problem, the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Identify the amount of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber needed is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] 3. Calculate the total number of bolts by adding the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
