            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes or uses each day. 3. Calculate the number of eggs left after consumption and use. 4. Determine how much money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs. Let's break it down step by step: 1. **Total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Eggs consumed or used each day:** - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. - Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs consumed or used each day is \\(3 + 4 = 7\\) eggs. 3. **Number of eggs left after consumption and use:** The number of eggs left each day is \\(16 - 7 = 9\\) eggs. 4. **Money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, the money she makes each day is \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\) dollars. So, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. Let's break this down step by step. 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber: The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the number of bolts of white fiber: The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, the number of bolts of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] So, the robe requires 1 bolt of white fiber. 3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber: To find the total number of bolts, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber and the number of bolts of white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber required is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
