                "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.\n2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day.\n3. Find out how many eggs Janet has left after consuming and baking.\n4. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the remaining eggs.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.**\n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day.**\n\nJanet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes 4 muffins for her friends every day. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed each day is:\n\\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find out how many eggs Janet has left after consuming and baking.**\n\nAfter consuming and baking, the number of eggs left each day is:\n\\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the remaining eggs.**\n\nJanet sells each fresh duck egg for $2.

Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day.\n3. Calculate how many eggs Janet sells each day.\n4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Total number of eggs Janet has each day:**\n   Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total eggs per day} = 16\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eggs Janet consumes each day:**\n   Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast each morning and bakes muffins for her friends each day with 4 eggs.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Eggs consumed per day} = 3 + 4 = 7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Eggs Janet sells each day:**\n   To find out how many eggs Janet sells each day, we subtract the number of eggs she consumes from the total number of eggs she has.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Eggs sold per day} = 16 - 7 = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total revenue from selling the eggs:**\n   Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is the number of eggs sold multiplied by the price per egg.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total revenue per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18\n   \\]\n\nThus, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.<|im_end|>"

Identify the amount of blue fiber required: The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n2. Determine the amount of white fiber required: The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber required is \\(2 \\div 2 = 1\\) bolt.\n3. Calculate the total number of bolts: The total number of bolts is the sum of the blue fiber and the white fiber.
