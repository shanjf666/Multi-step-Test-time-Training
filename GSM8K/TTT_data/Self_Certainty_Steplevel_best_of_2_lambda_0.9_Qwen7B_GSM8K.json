            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. Determine the total number of eggs Janet gets from her ducks each day. \\[ \\text{Total eggs per day} = 16 \\] 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day. \\[ \\text{Eggs eaten per day} = 3 \\] 3. Determine how many eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day. \\[ \\text{Eggs used for muffins per day} = 4 \\] 4. Calculate the number of eggs Janet has left after eating and baking each day. \\[ \\text{Eggs left per day} = \\text{Total eggs per day} - \\text{Eggs eaten per day} - \\text{Eggs used for muffins per day} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \\] 5. Determine how much money Janet makes each day by selling the remaining eggs at the farmers' market. \\[ \\text{Money made per day} = \\text{Eggs left per day} \\times \\text{Price per egg} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, the white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
