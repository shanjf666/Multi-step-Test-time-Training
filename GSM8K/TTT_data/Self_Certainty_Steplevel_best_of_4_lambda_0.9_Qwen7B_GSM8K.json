            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet gets from her ducks each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet bakes muffins with each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs baked} \\] \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = \\text{Total eggs laid} - \\text{Total eggs used} \\] \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine how much Janet earns from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. 7. **Calculate the total earnings from the eggs:** \\[ \\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Eggs sold} \\times \\text{Price per egg} \\] \\[ \\text{Total earnings} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. 3. Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber to get the total number of bolts. Let's start with the first step: The number of bolts of blue fiber required is 2. Next, we calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. According to the problem, the number of bolts of white fiber is half the number of bolts of blue fiber. Therefore, we have: \\[ \\text{Number of bolts of white fiber} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] Now, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber to find the total number of bolts: \\[ \\text{Total number of bolts} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\] So, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
