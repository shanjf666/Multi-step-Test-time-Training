            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet collects each day:** Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs used for muffins} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** Janet sells the remainder of the eggs after eating and baking. Therefore, the number of eggs sold is: \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = \\text{Total eggs collected} - \\text{Total eggs used} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the amount of money Janet makes from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes is: \\[ \\text{Total money made} = \\text{Eggs sold} \\times \\text{Price per egg} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Thus, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. According to the problem, the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Identify the amount of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, it requires \\(2 \\div 2 = 1\\) bolt of white fiber. 3. Calculate the total number of bolts by adding the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber. This gives us \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) bolts in total. Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
