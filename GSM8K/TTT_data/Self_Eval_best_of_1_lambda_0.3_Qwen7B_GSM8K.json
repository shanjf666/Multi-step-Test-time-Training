            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet collects per day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet eats:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine the number of eggs Janet uses to bake muffins:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs used for muffins} \\] \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells:** Janet sells the remainder of the eggs after eating and baking. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = \\text{Total eggs collected} - \\text{Total eggs used} \\] \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the revenue from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Revenue} = \\text{Eggs sold} \\times \\text{Price per egg} \\] \\[ \\text{Revenue} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. 3. Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Step 1: The number of bolts of blue fiber required is given as 2. Step 2: The number of bolts of white fiber required is half the number of bolts of blue fiber. Therefore, we calculate: \\[ \\text{Number of bolts of white fiber} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] Step 3: Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together: \\[ \\text{Total number of bolts} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
