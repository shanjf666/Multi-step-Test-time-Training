            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has after eating some for breakfast and baking some for her friends. 2. Determine how many eggs are left to sell. 3. Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs. **Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has after eating some for breakfast and baking some for her friends.** Janet starts with 16 eggs each day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\] **Step 2: Determine how many eggs are left to sell.** After using 7 eggs, the number of eggs left is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\] **Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs.** Janet sells each remaining egg for $2. So, the total amount of money she makes is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is: \\[ \\boxed{18} \\]|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",
