            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day. 3. Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day. 4. Compute the daily earnings from selling the eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Total number of eggs received each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Eggs consumed each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 3. **Eggs sold each day:** The number of eggs Janet sells each day is the total number of eggs received minus the total number of eggs consumed: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 4. **Daily earnings from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, her daily earnings are: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] So, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Identify the amount of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber required is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] 3. Calculate the total amount of fiber required by adding the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
