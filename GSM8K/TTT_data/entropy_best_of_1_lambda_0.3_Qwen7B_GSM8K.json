            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet lays each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day. 3. Determine how many eggs Janet bakes each day. 4. Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day. 5. Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes from selling the eggs each day. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. Janet bakes 4 eggs for her friends every day. 4. The number of eggs Janet sells each day is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs eaten and the number of eggs baked: \\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \\] So, Janet sells 9 eggs each day. 5. Janet sells each egg for $2. Therefore, the total amount of money Janet makes each day is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] So, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. First, we calculate the amount of white fiber needed: \\[ \\text{White fiber} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Next, we add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts: \\[ \\text{Total bolts} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
