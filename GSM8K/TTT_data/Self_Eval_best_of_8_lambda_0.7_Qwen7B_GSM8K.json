            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day. 3. Calculate the number of eggs Janet has left after consuming and baking. 4. Determine how much money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. \\[ \\text{Total eggs per day} = 16 \\] 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast each morning and bakes 4 muffins each day, which means she uses 4 eggs for baking. \\[ \\text{Eggs consumed per day} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 3. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet has left after consuming and baking:** Subtract the number of eggs consumed from the total number of eggs. \\[ \\text{Eggs left per day} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 4. **Determine how much money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Money made per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, the white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",
