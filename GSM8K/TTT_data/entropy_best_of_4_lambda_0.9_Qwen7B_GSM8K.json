            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how many fresh duck eggs Janet has left each day and how much she makes from selling them, we can follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet gets from her ducks each day. \\[ \\text{Total eggs per day} = 16 \\] 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day. \\[ \\text{Eggs eaten each day} = 3 \\] 3. Determine how many eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day. \\[ \\text{Eggs used for muffins each day} = 4 \\] 4. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day. \\[ \\text{Total eggs used each day} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. Calculate the number of fresh duck eggs Janet has left each day. \\[ \\text{Fresh duck eggs left each day} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. Determine how much Janet makes from selling the fresh duck eggs each day. \\[ \\text{Money made each day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. - The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the number of bolts of white fiber required. - The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. - Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the number of bolts of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] 3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber needed by adding the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber. - The total number of bolts is: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
