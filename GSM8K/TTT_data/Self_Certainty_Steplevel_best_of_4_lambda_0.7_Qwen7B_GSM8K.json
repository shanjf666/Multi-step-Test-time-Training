            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet lays each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day. 3. Determine how many eggs Janet bakes each day. 4. Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day. 5. Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes from selling the eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet lays each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet bakes each day:** Janet bakes 4 eggs each day for her friends. 4. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** The number of eggs Janet sells each day is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs she eats and the number of eggs she bakes. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold per day} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \\] 5. **Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Money made per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber required is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. The total number of bolts of fiber needed is the sum of the blue fiber and the white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
