            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet consumes each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine the number of eggs Janet uses each day for baking muffins:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used per day} = \\text{Eggs eaten for breakfast} + \\text{Eggs used for baking muffins} \\] \\[ \\text{Total eggs used per day} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** Janet sells the remainder of the eggs after consuming and using some. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold per day} = \\text{Total eggs received per day} - \\text{Total eggs used per day} \\] \\[ \\text{Eggs sold per day} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the revenue Janet earns from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Revenue per day} = \\text{Eggs sold per day} \\times \\text{Price per egg} \\] \\[ \\text{Revenue per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. 3. Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Step 1: The number of bolts of blue fiber required is given as 2. Step 2: The number of bolts of white fiber required is half the number of bolts of blue fiber. Therefore, we calculate: \\[ \\text{Number of bolts of white fiber} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] Step 3: Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together: \\[ \\text{Total number of bolts} = \\text{Number of bolts of blue fiber} + \\text{Number of bolts of white fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",
