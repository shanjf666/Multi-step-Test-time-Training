            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day. 3. Calculate the number of eggs remaining each day. 4. Determine how much money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Eggs Janet eats or uses each day:** - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. - Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs Janet eats or uses each day is \\(3 + 4 = 7\\) eggs. 3. **Number of eggs remaining each day:** The number of eggs remaining each day is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs eaten or used. \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\] So, Janet has 9 eggs remaining each day. 4. **Money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. Therefore, the final numeric answer is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To solve the problem step by step, let's break it down: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber needed for the robe. - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the amount of white fiber needed for the robe. - The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. - Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it takes \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) bolt of white fiber. 3. Calculate the total amount of fiber needed for the robe. - Total fiber = blue fiber + white fiber - Total fiber = 2 bolts + 1 bolt = 3 bolts Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
