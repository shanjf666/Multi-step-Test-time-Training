                "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet lying each day.\n2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats and bakes each day.\n3. Find out how many eggs remain after she eats and bakes.\n4. Calculate the amount of money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Total number of eggs lying each day:**\n   Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\n2. **Eggs eaten and baked each day:**\n   - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast each morning.\n   - Janet bakes 4 muffins for her friends each day.\n   - Each muffin is made with 1 egg, so she uses 4 eggs for baking.\n   - Total eggs eaten and baked each day = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.\n\n3. **Remaining eggs after eating and baking:**\n   Remaining eggs = Total eggs lying - Total eggs eaten and baked = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\n\n4. **Money made from selling the remaining eggs:**\n   Janet sells each remaining egg for $2.\n   Total money made = Number of remaining eggs × Price per egg = 9 × 2 = $18.\n\nTherefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).<|im_end|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",
