            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet identities per day:** Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. \\[ \\text{Eggs consumed for breakfast} = 3 \\] 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. \\[ \\text{Eggs used for muffins} = 4 \\] 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** Add the eggs consumed for breakfast and the eggs used for muffins. \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Determine the number of eggs remaining each day:** Subtract the total number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid. \\[ \\text{Eggs remaining} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. \\[ \\text{Revenue} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together to get the total. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, the white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together to get the total. The total number of bolts is the sum of the blue fiber and the white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
