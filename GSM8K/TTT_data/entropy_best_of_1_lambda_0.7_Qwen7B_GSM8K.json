            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day. 3. Determine how many eggs Janet bakes each day. 4. Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day. 5. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet bakes each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** First, we find out how many eggs Janet uses each day: \\[ \\text{Eggs used each day} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs baked} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] Since Janet starts with 16 eggs each day and uses 7 eggs, the number of eggs she sells each day is: \\[ \\text{Eggs sold each day} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each egg for $2, so the total revenue is: \\[ \\text{Total revenue} = \\text{Eggs sold} \\times \\text{Price per egg} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. 3. Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the number of bolts of white fiber required is: \\[ 2 \\div 2 = 1 \\] Step 3: Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Now, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
