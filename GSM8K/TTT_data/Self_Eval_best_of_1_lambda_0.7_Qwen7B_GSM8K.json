            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet bakes muffins with each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed or used each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs consumed or used} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs baked} \\] \\[ \\text{Total eggs consumed or used} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs left to sell each day:** \\[ \\text{Eggs left to sell} = \\text{Total eggs laid} - \\text{Total eggs consumed or used} \\] \\[ \\text{Eggs left to sell} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the amount Janet earns from selling the remaining eggs each day:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Earnings per day} = \\text{Eggs left to sell} \\times \\text{Price per egg} \\] \\[ \\text{Earnings per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Identify the amount of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \\(2 \\div 2 = 1\\) bolt of white fiber. 3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber by adding the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber. This is \\(2 + 1 = 3\\). Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
