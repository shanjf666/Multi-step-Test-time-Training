            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day. 3. Find out how many eggs are left after she eats and uses some. 4. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 3. The number of eggs left after she eats and uses some is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 4. Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. So, the total amount of money she makes every day is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] Therefore, the final answer is: \\[ \\boxed{18} \\]",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the amount of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \\(2 \\div 2 = 1\\) bolt of white fiber. 3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber by adding the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together. This gives us \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) bolts in total. Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
