            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet gets from her ducks each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day. 3. Calculate how many eggs remain after she eats and uses some. 4. Determine how much money she makes from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet gets from her ducks each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she eats or uses each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 3. **Calculate how many eggs remain after she eats and uses some:** The number of eggs remaining after she eats and uses some is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 4. **Determine how much money she makes from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each remaining egg for $2. So, the total amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, we need to calculate half of 2 bolts: \\[ \\text{White fiber} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Now, we add the 2 bolts of blue fiber and the 1 bolt of white fiber: \\[ \\text{Total fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
