            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet gets from her ducks each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine the number of eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used per day} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs used for muffins} \\] \\[ \\text{Total eggs used per day} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** Janet sells the remainder of the eggs after eating and using some for muffins. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold per day} = \\text{Total eggs laid} - \\text{Total eggs used} \\] \\[ \\text{Eggs sold per day} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the amount Janet earns from selling the eggs each day:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Earnings per day} = \\text{Eggs sold per day} \\times \\text{Price per egg} \\] \\[ \\text{Earnings per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, the white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: \\[ 2 \\text{ bolts} + 1 \\text{ bolt} = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||",
