            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet collects each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs used for muffins} \\] \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet has left each day:** \\[ \\text{Eggs left} = \\text{Total eggs collected} - \\text{Total eggs used} \\] \\[ \\text{Eggs left} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine how much Janet sells each fresh duck egg:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. 7. **Calculate the total amount Janet makes each day at the farmers' market:** \\[ \\text{Total amount made} = \\text{Eggs left} \\times \\text{Price per egg} \\] \\[ \\text{Total amount made} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber to find the total. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber required is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber to find the total. The total number of bolts of fiber required is the sum of the blue fiber and the white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber required is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
