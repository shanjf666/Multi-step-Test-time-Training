            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day. 3. Calculate the number of eggs remaining each day. 4. Calculate the amount of money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she eats or uses each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining each day:** The number of eggs remaining each day is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs eaten or used: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 4. **Calculate the amount of money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each remaining egg for $2. So, the amount of money she makes each day is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. 3. Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Step 1: The number of bolts of blue fiber required is given as 2. Step 2: The number of bolts of white fiber required is half the number of bolts of blue fiber. Therefore, we calculate: \\[ \\text{Number of bolts of white fiber} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] Step 3: Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together: \\[ \\text{Total number of bolts} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",
