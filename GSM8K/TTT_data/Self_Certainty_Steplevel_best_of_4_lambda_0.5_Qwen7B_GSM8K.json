            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives daily:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet eats daily:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine the number of eggs Janet bakes daily:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses daily:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used daily} = \\text{Eggs eaten daily} + \\text{Eggs baked daily} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells daily:** Janet sells the remainder of the eggs after eating and baking. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold daily} = \\text{Total eggs received daily} - \\text{Total eggs used daily} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the amount Janet earns from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Earnings daily} = \\text{Eggs sold daily} \\times \\text{Price per egg} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required. 1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, it requires \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) bolt of white fiber. Next, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
