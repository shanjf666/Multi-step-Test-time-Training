            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. **Determine the total number of eggs Janet gets each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. \\[ \\text{Total eggs per day} = 16 \\] 2. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. \\[ \\text{Eggs eaten per day} = 3 \\] 3. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. \\[ \\text{Eggs used for muffins per day} = 4 \\] 4. **Determine the number of eggs Janet has left after eating and baking:** Subtract the eggs eaten and the eggs used for muffins from the total number of eggs. \\[ \\text{Eggs left per day} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \\] 5. **Calculate the amount of money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. \\[ \\text{Money made per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber required and then sum them up. 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber needed: The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Identify the amount of white fiber needed: The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, the white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] 3. Calculate the total number of bolts: Add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is \\boxed{3}.",
