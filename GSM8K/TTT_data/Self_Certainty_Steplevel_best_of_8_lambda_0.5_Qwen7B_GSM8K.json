            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day. 3. Find out how many eggs remain after consumption. 4. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs. **Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. **Step 2: Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day.** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] **Step 3: Find out how many eggs remain after consumption.** The number of eggs remaining after consumption is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] **Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, the revenue from selling 9 eggs is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] So, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is: \\[ \\boxed{18} \\]",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Let's start with the blue fiber: - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Next, we calculate the amount of white fiber: - The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. - Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is \\(2 \\div 2 = 1\\) bolt. Now, we add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: - Blue fiber: 2 bolts - White fiber: 1 bolt - Total fiber: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) bolts Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
