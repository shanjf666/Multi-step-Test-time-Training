            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of duck eggs Janet gets each day. 2. Determine how many duck eggs Janet eats or uses each day. 3. Find out how many duck eggs remain after she eats and uses some. 4. Calculate the amount of money she makes from selling the remaining duck eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Total number of duck eggs per day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Duck eggs eaten or used per day:** - Janet eats 3 duck eggs for breakfast every morning. - Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 duck eggs. - Total duck eggs eaten or used per day = 3 + 4 = 7. 3. **Remaining duck eggs per day:** Remaining duck eggs = Total duck eggs - Duck eggs eaten or used Remaining duck eggs = 16 - 7 = 9. 4. **Money made from selling the remaining duck eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Money made = Remaining duck eggs × Price per duck egg Money made = 9 × 2 = 18. Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required: The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Identify the amount of white fiber required: The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \\(2 / 2 = 1\\) bolt of white fiber. 3. Calculate the total number of bolts: Add the number of bolts of blue fiber to the number of bolts of white fiber. This gives us \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) bolts in total. Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
