            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day. 3. Determine how many eggs Janet bakes each day. 4. Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day. 5. Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes from selling the eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. \\[ \\text{Total eggs per day} = 16 \\] 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. \\[ \\text{Eggs eaten per day} = 3 \\] 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet bakes each day:** Janet bakes 4 muffins for her friends every day. Since each muffin is made from 1 egg (assuming each muffin uses 1 egg), she uses 4 eggs for baking. \\[ \\text{Eggs baked per day} = 4 \\] 4. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** The number of eggs Janet sells is the total number of eggs laid minus the eggs she eats and the eggs she bakes. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold per day} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \\] 5. **Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes is the number of eggs sold multiplied by the price per egg. \\[ \\text{Total money made per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] So, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\boxed{18}.|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. According to the problem, the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the number of bolts of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the number of bolts of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] 3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber by adding the number of bolts of blue fiber and the number of bolts of white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
