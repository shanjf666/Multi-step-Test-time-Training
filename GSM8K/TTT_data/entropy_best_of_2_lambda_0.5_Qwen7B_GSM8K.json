            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes or uses each day. 3. Find out how many eggs remain after consumption and usage. 4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet consumes or uses each day:** - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. - Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs consumed or used each day is \\(3 + 4 = 7\\). 3. **Find out how many eggs remain after consumption and usage:** The number of eggs remaining each day is \\(16 - 7 = 9\\). 4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. So, the total revenue is \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\). Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: The amount of white fiber required is half the amount of blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
