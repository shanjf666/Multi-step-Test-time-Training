            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats and uses each day. 3. Find out how many eggs remain each day. 4. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs. **Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. **Step 2: Determine how many eggs Janet eats and uses each day.** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, and she bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she eats and uses each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] **Step 3: Find out how many eggs remain each day.** The number of eggs remaining each day after Janet eats and uses some is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] **Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.** Janet sells each remaining egg for $2. So, the revenue from selling 9 eggs is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. 3. Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Let's start with the blue fiber: - The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Next, we calculate the number of bolts of white fiber: - The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. - Since the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, the number of bolts of white fiber is \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\). Now, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together: - The total number of bolts of fiber is \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\). Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber required is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
