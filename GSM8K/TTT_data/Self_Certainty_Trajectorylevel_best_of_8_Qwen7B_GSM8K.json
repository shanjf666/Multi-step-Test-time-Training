            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats and uses each day. 3. Calculate the number of eggs remaining each day. 4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats and uses each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses each day is \\(3 + 4 = 7\\). 3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining each day:** The number of eggs remaining each day is the total number of eggs laid minus the number of eggs eaten and used. So, the number of eggs remaining each day is \\(16 - 7 = 9\\). 4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each remaining egg for $2. So, the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs is \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\). Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Identify the amount of blue fiber required:** The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. **Calculate the amount of white fiber required:** The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, we calculate the white fiber as follows: \\[ \\text{White fiber} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] 3. **Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together:** Now, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber to find the total number of bolts: \\[ \\text{Total bolts} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
