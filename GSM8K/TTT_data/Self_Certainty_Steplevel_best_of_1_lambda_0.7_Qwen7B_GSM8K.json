            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet collects each day:** Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine the number of eggs Janet bakes muffins with each day:** Janet bakes muffins with 4 eggs each day. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs baked} \\] \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** Janet sells the remainder of the eggs after eating and baking. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = \\text{Total eggs collected} - \\text{Total eggs used} \\] \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the revenue Janet earns from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Revenue} = \\text{Eggs sold} \\times \\text{Price per egg} \\] \\[ \\text{Revenue} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together to get the total. Let's start with the blue fiber: - The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Next, we calculate the amount of white fiber: - The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. - Since the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber required is \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) bolt. Now, we add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: - Blue fiber: 2 bolts - White fiber: 1 bolt - Total fiber: \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\) bolts Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
