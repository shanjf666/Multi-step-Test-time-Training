            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet uses each day for baking muffins:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs used for muffins} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining each day after consumption:** \\[ \\text{Remaining eggs} = \\text{Total eggs received} - \\text{Total eggs used} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine how much Janet sells the remaining eggs for:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. 7. **Calculate the total amount Janet makes each day at the farmers' market:** \\[ \\text{Total earnings} = \\text{Remaining eggs} \\times \\text{Price per egg} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: The amount of white fiber required is half the amount of blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber needed is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: \\[ 2 \\text{ bolts} + 1 \\text{ bolt} = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
