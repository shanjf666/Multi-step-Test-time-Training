            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives from her ducks each day.** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet consumes each day.** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. She also bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 3. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet has left after consuming some.** The number of eggs left after consumption is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 4. **Determine how much Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs.** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling 9 eggs is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] Thus, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, we need to find half of 2 bolts: \\[ \\text{White fiber} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Now, we add the 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber: \\[ \\text{Total fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] So, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
