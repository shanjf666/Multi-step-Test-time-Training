            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes each day. 3. Find out how many eggs remain after consumption. 4. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Total number of eggs per day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Eggs consumed each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. \\[ \\text{Total eggs consumed per day} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 3. **Remaining eggs after consumption:** Subtract the number of eggs consumed from the total number of eggs laid. \\[ \\text{Remaining eggs per day} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 4. **Daily earnings from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each remaining egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Daily earnings} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts needed to make the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. 3. Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Step 1: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: The robe takes half as many bolts of white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the number of bolts of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] Step 3: Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Thus, the total number of bolts needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
