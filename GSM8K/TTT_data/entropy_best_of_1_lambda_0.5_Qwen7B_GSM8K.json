            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet touches each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats. 3. Determine how many eggs Janet bakes. 4. Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells. 5. Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Total number of eggs Janet touches each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Eggs Janet eats:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. \\[ \\text{Eggs eaten} = 3 \\] 3. **Eggs Janet bakes:** Janet bakes 4 muffins for her friends every day, and each muffin requires 1 egg. \\[ \\text{Eggs baked} = 4 \\] 4. **Eggs Janet sells:** The total number of eggs Janet touches each day is 16. After eating 3 eggs and baking 4 eggs, the number of eggs left to sell is: \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \\] 5. **Total revenue from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is: \\[ \\text{Total revenue} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Thus, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to consider both the blue and white fibers. 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required: The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the number of bolts of white fiber required: The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the number of bolts of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] 3. Calculate the total number of bolts needed: To find the total number of bolts, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber to the number of bolts of white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
