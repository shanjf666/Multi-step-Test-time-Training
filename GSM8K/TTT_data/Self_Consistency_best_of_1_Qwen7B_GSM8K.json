                "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.\n2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes or uses each day.\n3. Calculate the number of eggs left after consumption and usage.\n4. Determine the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.**\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many eggs Janet consumes or uses each day.**\nJanet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs.\nSo, the total number of eggs consumed or used each day is:\n\\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs left after consumption and usage.**\nThe number of eggs left after consumption and usage is:\n\\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the revenue from selling the remaining eggs.**\nJanet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. So, the revenue is:\n\\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]<|im_end|>"

                "To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n2. Identify the amount of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it takes \\(2 \\div 2 = 1\\) bolt of white fiber.\n3. Calculate the total number of bolts by adding the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber. This gives us \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) bolts in total.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bolts needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).<|im_end|>"
