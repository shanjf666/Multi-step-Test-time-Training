            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives from her ducks each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet consumes and uses each day. 3. Calculate the number of eggs left after consumption and usage. 4. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives from her ducks each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. \\[ \\text{Total eggs per day} = 16 \\] 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet consumes and uses each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. \\[ \\text{Eggs consumed and used per day} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 3. **Calculate the number of eggs left after consumption and usage:** Subtract the number of eggs consumed and used from the total number of eggs received. \\[ \\text{Eggs left per day} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Revenue per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to break down the problem step by step. 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. - The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the number of bolts of white fiber required. - The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the number of bolts of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] 3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber by adding the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber. - The total number of bolts of fiber is: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
