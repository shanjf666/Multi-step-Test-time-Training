            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day. 3. Calculate how many eggs Janet sells each day. 4. Calculate how much money Janet makes from selling the eggs. **Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.** Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. **Step 2: Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day.** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she eats each day is: \\[3 + 4 = 7\\] **Step 3: Calculate how many eggs Janet sells each day.** The number of eggs Janet sells each day is the total number of eggs she has minus the number of eggs she eats: \\[16 - 7 = 9\\] **Step 4: Calculate how much money Janet makes from selling the eggs.** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. So, the total amount of money she makes each day is: \\[9 \\times 2 = 18\\] Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. 3. Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as many bolts of white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the number of bolts of white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] Step 3: Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Now, we add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
