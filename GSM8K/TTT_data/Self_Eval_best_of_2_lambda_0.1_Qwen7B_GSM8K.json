            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet gets from her ducks each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats or bakes each day. 3. Find out how many eggs are left after she eats and bakes. 4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes 4 eggs for her friends every day. Therefore, the total number of eggs she uses each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 3. The number of eggs left after she eats and bakes is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 4. Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. Therefore, the total revenue she makes every day is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] So, the final answer is: \\[ \\boxed{18} \\]|im_end|||",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together to find the total. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber required is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together to find the total. The total number of bolts of fiber needed is the sum of the blue fiber and the white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|",
