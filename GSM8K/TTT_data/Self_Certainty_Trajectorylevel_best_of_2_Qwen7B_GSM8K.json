            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives per day:** Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet eats per day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine the number of eggs Janet uses for baking muffins per day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses per day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used per day} = \\text{Eggs eaten per day} + \\text{Eggs used for baking muffins per day} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells per day:** Janet sells the remainder of the eggs she receives after eating and using some for baking muffins. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold per day} = \\text{Total eggs received per day} - \\text{Total eggs used per day} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the amount of money Janet makes from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Money made per day} = \\text{Eggs sold per day} \\times \\text{Price per egg} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, the white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. The total number of bolts of fiber is: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
