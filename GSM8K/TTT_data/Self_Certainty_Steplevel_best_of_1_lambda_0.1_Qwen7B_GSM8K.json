            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day. 3. Calculate the number of eggs left after she eats and uses some. 4. Calculate the amount of money Janet makes by selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day:** - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. - Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs Janet eats or uses each day is \\(3 + 4 = 7\\) eggs. 3. **Calculate the number of eggs left after she eats and uses some:** The number of eggs left each day is \\(16 - 7 = 9\\) eggs. 4. **Calculate the amount of money Janet makes by selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. Therefore, the amount of money she makes each day is \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\) dollars. So, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber needed. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber needed. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, the white fiber needed is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber required is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
