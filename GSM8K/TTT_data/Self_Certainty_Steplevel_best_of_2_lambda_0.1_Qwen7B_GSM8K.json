            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet collects per day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats and uses. 3. Calculate the number of eggs left after eating and using some. 4. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Total number of eggs collected per day:** Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Eggs eaten and used:** - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. - Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. - Total eggs eaten and used per day = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 3. **Eggs left after eating and using some:** - Total eggs collected per day = 16 eggs. - Total eggs eaten and used per day = 7 eggs. - Eggs left per day = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. 4. **Revenue from selling the remaining eggs:** - Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. - Revenue per day = 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18. Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber required is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Now, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
