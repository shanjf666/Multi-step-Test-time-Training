            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day. 3. Find out how many eggs remain after she eats and uses some. 4. Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 3. **Find out how many eggs remain after she eats and uses some:** The number of eggs remaining each day is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each remaining egg for $2. So, the total revenue she makes each day is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Let's break this down step by step. 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber needed: \\[ \\text{Blue fiber} = 2 \\text{ bolts} \\] 2. Determine the number of bolts of white fiber needed. Since the white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber: \\[ \\text{White fiber} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] 3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber by adding the blue fiber and the white fiber: \\[ \\text{Total fiber} = \\text{Blue fiber} + \\text{White fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
