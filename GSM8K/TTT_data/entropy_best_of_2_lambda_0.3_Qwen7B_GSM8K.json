            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet drives each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine how many eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine how many eggs Janet bakes muffins with:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day (eats + bakes):** \\[ 3 \\text{ eggs} + 4 \\text{ eggs} = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sell each day:** Subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs she drives: \\[ 16 \\text{ eggs} - 7 \\text{ eggs} = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 6. **Determine how much Janet earns per fresh duck egg:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. 7. **Calculate the total earnings Janet makes each day:** Multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg: \\[ 9 \\text{ eggs} \\times 2 \\text{ dollars per egg} = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps. 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required: - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the amount of white fiber required: - The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \\(2 \\div 2 = 1\\) bolt of white fiber. 3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber: - Add the number of bolts of blue fiber to the number of bolts of white fiber. This gives us \\(2 + 1 = 3\\) bolts in total. Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
