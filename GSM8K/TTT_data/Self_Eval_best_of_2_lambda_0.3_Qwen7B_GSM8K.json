            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives each day:** Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine the number of eggs Janet uses for baking muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs used for baking} \\] \\[ \\text{Total eggs used} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** Subtract the total number of eggs used from the total number of eggs received. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = \\text{Total eggs received} - \\text{Total eggs used} \\] \\[ \\text{Eggs sold} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the amount Janet earns from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Earnings} = \\text{Eggs sold} \\times \\text{Price per egg} \\] \\[ \\text{Earnings} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.|im_end|",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together to find the total. Step 1: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the blue fiber is 2 bolts, the white fiber is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together: \\[ 2 \\text{ bolts} + 1 \\text{ bolt} = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",
