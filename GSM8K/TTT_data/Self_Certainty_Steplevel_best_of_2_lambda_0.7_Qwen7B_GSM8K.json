            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day. 3. Find out how many eggs are left after she eats and uses some. 4. Calculate the amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs. **Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day.** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. **Step 2: Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day.** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she eats or uses each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\] **Step 3: Find out how many eggs are left after she eats and uses some.** After eating and using 7 eggs, the number of eggs left is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\] **Step 4: Calculate the amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs.** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. So, the amount of money she makes from selling 9 eggs is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber required is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Now, we add the 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\text{ bolts} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
