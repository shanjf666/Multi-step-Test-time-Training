            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and the number of eggs she uses to bake muffins. 3. Determine how many eggs are left to sell. 4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and the number of eggs she uses to bake muffins:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs used each day is \\(3 + 4 = 7\\). Therefore, the number of eggs left to sell each day is \\(16 - 7 = 9\\). 3. **Determine how many eggs are left to sell:** Janet has 9 eggs left to sell each day. 4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. So, the total revenue each day is \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\). Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required: The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the amount of white fiber required: The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \\(2 \\div 2 = 1\\) bolt of white fiber. 3. Calculate the total amount of fiber: The total amount of fiber is the sum of the blue fiber and the white fiber. Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber is \\(2 + 1 = 3\\). The final numeric answer is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
