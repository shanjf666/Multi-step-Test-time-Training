            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. 3. **Determine the number of eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** \\[ \\text{Total eggs used per day} = \\text{Eggs eaten} + \\text{Eggs for muffins} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining each day:** \\[ \\text{Remaining eggs per day} = \\text{Total eggs laid} - \\text{Total eggs used} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Determine the amount of money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Money made per day} = \\text{Remaining eggs per day} \\times \\text{Price per egg} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the number of bolts of white fiber required. 3. Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together. Step 1: The number of bolts of blue fiber required is given as 2. Step 2: The number of bolts of white fiber required is half the number of bolts of blue fiber. Therefore, we calculate: \\[ \\text{Number of bolts of white fiber} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\] Step 3: Add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together: \\[ \\text{Total number of bolts} = 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
