            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has after eating some for breakfast. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet uses to bake muffins. 3. Find out how many eggs remain after breakfast and baking. 4. Calculate the total earnings from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. \\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \\text{ eggs} \\] So, after eating eggs for breakfast, Janet has 13 eggs left. 2. Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. \\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] So, after baking muffins, Janet has 9 eggs left. 3. Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. Therefore, the final answer is: \\[ \\boxed{18} \\]",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber required is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. The total number of bolts of fiber needed is the sum of the blue fiber and the white fiber: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
