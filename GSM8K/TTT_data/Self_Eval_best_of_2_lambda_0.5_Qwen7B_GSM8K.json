            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day. 2. Determine how many eggs Janet eats or uses each day. 3. Calculate how many eggs remain after she eats and uses some. 4. Determine how much money Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs. Let's go through each step in detail: 1. Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. So, the total number of eggs she uses each day is: \\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\] 3. The number of eggs remaining after she eats and uses some is: \\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\] 4. Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. So, the amount of money she makes each day is: \\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\] Therefore, the final answer is: \\[ \\boxed{18} \\]|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. - The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 2. Determine the amount of white fiber required. - The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. - Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber needed is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber} \\] 3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber needed. - Add the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber: \\[ 2 \\text{ bolts of blue fiber} + 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber} = 3 \\text{ bolts of fiber} \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\boxed{3}.|im_end|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",
