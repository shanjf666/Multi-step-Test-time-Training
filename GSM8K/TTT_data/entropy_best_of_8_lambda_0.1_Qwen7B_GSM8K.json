            "question": "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
            "answer": "To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet receives each day:** Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. \\[ \\text{Total eggs per day} = 16 \\] 2. **Determine the number of eggs Janet eats each day:** Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. \\[ \\text{Eggs eaten per day} = 3 \\] 3. **Determine the number of eggs Janet uses to bake muffins each day:** Janet bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs. \\[ \\text{Eggs used for muffins per day} = 4 \\] 4. **Calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses each day:** Add the eggs eaten and the eggs used for muffins. \\[ \\text{Total eggs used per day} = 3 + 4 = 7 \\] 5. **Determine the number of eggs Janet sells each day:** Subtract the total number of eggs used from the total number of eggs received. \\[ \\text{Eggs sold per day} = 16 - 7 = 9 \\] 6. **Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes from selling the eggs:** Janet sells each fresh duck egg for $2. \\[ \\text{Total money made per day} = 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\] Therefore, Janet makes \\(\\boxed{18}\\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.",

            "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
            "answer": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the amount of blue fiber required. 2. Calculate the amount of white fiber required. 3. Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem also states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber required is: \\[ \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt} \\] Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber together. Now, we add the 2 bolts of blue fiber and the 1 bolt of white fiber to find the total number of bolts of fiber needed: \\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \\] Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
