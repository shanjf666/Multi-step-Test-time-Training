{"question": "The value of $y$ varies inversely as $\\sqrt x$ and when $x=24$, $y=15$. What is $x$ when $y=3$?", "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem states that $y$ varies inversely as $\\sqrt{x}$, which means that $y = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}}$ where $k$ is a constant.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given information to solve for the constant $k$\nWe are given that when $x=24$, $y=15$. We can substitute these values into the equation to solve for $k$: $15 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{24}}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $k$\nTo solve for $k$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $\\sqrt{24}$ to get $k = 15 \\times \\sqrt{24}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for $k$\nWe can simplify the expression for $k$ by evaluating the square root of 24. $\\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6} = 2\\sqrt{6}$, so $k = 15 \\times 2\\sqrt{6} = 30\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write the equation with the value of $k$\nNow that we have found $k$, we can substitute it back into the original equation: $y = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $x$ when $y=3$\nTo solve for $x$ when $y=3$, we can substitute $y=3$ into the equation and solve for $x$: $3 = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}}$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $x$\nTo solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $\\sqrt{x}$ to get $3\\sqrt{x} = 30\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n## Step 8: Divide both sides by $\\sqrt{6}$\nTo isolate $x$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $\\sqrt{6}$ to get $\\frac{3\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{6}} = 30$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression for $x$\nWe can simplify the expression for $x$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3\\sqrt{6}}$ to get $\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{2} = 30$.\n\n## Step 10: Multiply both sides by $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}$\nTo isolate $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}$ to get $\\sqrt{x} = 60$.\n\n## Step 11: Square both sides to solve for $x$\nTo solve for $x$, we can square both sides of the equation to get $x = 60^2$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the final answer\n$x = 60^2 = 3600$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3600}$"}
