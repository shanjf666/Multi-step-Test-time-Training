{"question": "The value of $y$ varies inversely as $\\sqrt x$ and when $x=24$, $y=15$. What is $x$ when $y=3$?", "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem states that $y$ varies inversely as $\\sqrt{x}$, which means that $y = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}}$ where $k$ is a constant.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given information to solve for the constant $k$\nWe are given that when $x=24$, $y=15$. We can substitute these values into the equation to solve for $k$: $15 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{24}}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $k$\nTo solve for $k$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $\\sqrt{24}$ to get $k = 15 \\times \\sqrt{24}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for $k$\nWe can simplify the expression for $k$ by evaluating the square root of 24. $\\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6} = 2\\sqrt{6}$, so $k = 15 \\times 2\\sqrt{6} = 30\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write the equation with the value of $k$\nNow that we have found $k$, we can substitute it back into the original equation: $y = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $x$ when $y=3$\nTo solve for $x$ when $y=3$, we can substitute $y=3$ into the equation and solve for $x$: $3 = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}}$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $x$\nTo solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $\\sqrt{x}$ to get $3\\sqrt{x} = 30\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n## Step 8: Divide both sides by $\\sqrt{6}$\nTo isolate $x$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $\\sqrt{6}$ to get $\\frac{3\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{6}} = 30$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression for $x$\nWe can simplify the expression for $x$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3\\sqrt{6}}$ to get $\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{2} = 30$.\n\n## Step 10: Multiply both sides by $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}$\nTo isolate $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}$ to get $\\sqrt{x} = 60$.\n\n## Step 11: Square both sides to solve for $x$\nTo solve for $x$, we can square both sides of the equation to get $x = 60^2$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the final answer\n$x = 60^2 = 3600$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3600}$"}
{"question": "If a snack-size tin of peaches has $40$ calories and is $2\\%$ of a person's daily caloric requirement, how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement?", "answer": "## Step 1: Calculate the daily caloric requirement of a person\nTo find out how many calories a person needs to fulfill their daily caloric requirement, we need to calculate 100% of the daily caloric requirement. Since the snack-size tin of peaches is 2% of the person's daily caloric requirement, we can set up the equation: 2% of the daily caloric requirement = 40 calories.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the percentage to a decimal\nTo calculate 2% as a decimal, we divide by 100: 2 / 100 = 0.02.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation to solve for the daily caloric requirement\nLet x be the daily caloric requirement. We can set up the equation as follows: 0.02x = 40.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for x\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.02: x = 40 / 0.02.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the daily caloric requirement\nx = 40 / 0.02 = 2000.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the number of calories that fulfill the daily caloric requirement\nSince a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories, we need to divide the daily caloric requirement by the calories per tin to find out how many calories fulfill the daily caloric requirement: 2000 / 40 = 50.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{50}$"}
