{"question": "How many license plates can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one digit (0-9) numbers?", "answer": " To determine the number of possible license plates, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet and the number of ways to choose 2 different digits from the 10 digits (0 through 9). The total number of possible license plates is the product of these two values.\n\n1. The number of ways to choose 2 different letters from 26 letters is given by the permutation \\(P(26, 2) = 26 \\times 25\\).\n2. The number of ways to choose 2 different digits from 10 digits is given by the permutation \\(P(10, 2) = 10 \\times 9\\).\n\nThe total number of possible license plates is the product of these two values: \\(26 \\times 25 \\times 10 \\times 9\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n```python\n# Calculate the number of possible license plates\nnum_letters = 26\nnum_digits = 10\n\n# Number of ways to choose 2 different letters from 26\nletter_permutations = num_letters * (num_letters - 1)\n\n# Number of ways to choose 2 different digits from 10\ndigit_permutations = num_digits * (num_digits - 1)\n\n# Total number of possible license plates\ntotal_license_plates = letter_permutations * digit_permutations\nprint(total_license_plates)\n```\n```output\n58500\n```\nThe total number of possible license plates is \\(\\boxed{58500}\\)."}
