Since the wheel is spun twice, and each number on the wheel is equally likely, there are $4^2 = 16$ possible outcomes.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the checker is placed on a shaded square. We can consider the two numbers determined by the wheel and the checkerboard as a system of linear equations. Let's denote the numbers on the wheel as $x$ and $y$ and the numbers on the checkerboard as $a$ and $b$. The given equations are $x \\equiv a \\pmod{4}$ and $y \\equiv b \\pmod{5}$.\n## Step 4:  We are given that $x$ and $y$ are the numbers determined by the wheel, and $a$ and $b$ are the numbers on the checkerboard. We need to find the number of solutions to these equations that satisfy both $x \\equiv a \\pmod{4}$ and $y \\equiv b \\pmod{5}$.\n## Step 5:  The solutions to these equations can be found by considering the possible values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both congruences.

{"question": "How many integers are in the solution set of $|x-2|\\leq5.6$ ?", "answer": "## Step 1: Understand the inequality\nThe given inequality is $|x-2|\\leq5.6$. This means that the distance of $x$ from 2 is less than or equal to 5.6.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the inequality\nTo solve the inequality, we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the condition. We can do this by considering two cases: when $x-2$ is positive and when $x-2$ is negative.\n\n## Step 3: Case 1 - When $x-2$ is positive\nWhen $x-2$ is positive, we have $x-2 \\leq 5.6$. Adding 2 to both sides of the inequality gives $x \\leq 7.6$.\n\n## Step 4: Case 2 - When $x-2$ is negative\nWhen $x-2$ is negative, we have $-(x-2) \\leq 5.6$. This simplifies to $-x+2 \\leq 5.6$. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives $-x \\leq 3.6$. Multiplying both sides by -1 gives $x \\geq -3.6$.\n\n## Step 5: Combine the two cases\nCombining the two cases, we get $-3.6 \\leq x \\leq 7.6$. This is the solution set of the inequality.\n\n## Step 6: Count the integers in the solution set\nThe integers in the solution set are $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$. There are 10 integers in the solution set.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"}
