{"question": "The asymptotes of a hyperbola are $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x.$  Also, the hyperbola passes through the point $(4,7).$  Find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola.", "answer": " The given asymptotes of the hyperbola are \\( y = 2x - 3 \\) and \\( y = 17 - 2x \\). The center of the hyperbola is the intersection point of these two lines. To find the center, we solve the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\ny = 2x - 3 \\\\\ny = 17 - 2x\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSetting the equations equal to each other:\n\n\\[\n2x - 3 = 17 - 2x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n4x = 20 \\implies x = 5\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 5 \\) back into \\( y = 2x - 3 \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 2(5) - 3 = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, the center of the hyperbola is \\((5, 7)\\).\n\nThe equations of the asymptotes can be written in the form \\( y - 7 = 2(x - 5) \\) and \\( y - 7 = -2(x - 5) \\). This tells us that the hyperbola is centered at \\((5, 7)\\) and the slopes of the asymptotes are \\( \\pm 2 \\). The standard form of a hyperbola with horizontal transverse axis and center \\((h, k)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nThe slopes of the asymptotes for this hyperbola are \\( \\pm \\frac{b}{a} \\). Since the slopes are \\( \\pm 2 \\), we have \\( \\frac{b}{a} = 2 \\) or \\( b = 2a \\).\n\nThe hyperbola passes through the point \\((4, 7)\\). Substituting this point into the standard form of the hyperbola:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(4 - 5)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(7 - 7)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\implies \\frac{1}{a^2} = 1 \\implies a^2 = 1 \\implies a = 1\n\\]\n\nSince \\( b = 2a \\), we have \\( b = 2 \\). The distance between the foci of the hyperbola is \\( 2c \\), where \\( c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). Substituting \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4} = \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance between the foci is \\( 2c = 2\\sqrt{5} \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]"}
